"""Embedding analysis and semantic distance calculation.

This module provides tools for analyzing semantic drift in translations
using sentence embeddings and various distance metrics.

Main components:
    - EmbeddingGenerator: Creates sentence embeddings
    - SemanticDriftAnalyzer: Analyzes translation quality degradation
    - distance_calculator: Computes cosine and Euclidean distances
